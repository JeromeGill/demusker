# DeMusker Chrome Extension

If you, too, are wanting to use twitter without being inundated with noise about the idiot savant himself and his every inane utterance, the DeMusker is for you. Blocking him is a start, but the DeMusker goes a step further, and hides any tweet that mentions him.

You are welcome.

Unfortunately, people insist on screenshotting his tweets too, and processing images for this seems unjustifiable in terms of melting icecaps for your tweetin' pleasure. If you care that much, I recommend you log off. Or politely ask them to stop it.

## Installation
To use the chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

2. Open Google Chrome and type chrome://extensions in the address bar. This will open the Chrome extensions page.

3. Enable developer mode by clicking the toggle switch in the top-right corner of the page.

4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

The extension should now be loaded in your local browser. You may need to refresh the page for the changes to take effect.

## Usage
After installing the extension, a new button will appear in your Chrome toolbar. Click on this button to open the extension's options page.

On the options page, you can use the checkboxes to enable or disable the following options:

Hide retweets: Hides all retweets from your feed.

If you want to contribute to the development of the Twitter Hider extension, you can fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request with your changes.
